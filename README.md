# A basic A-Frame scene with a custom component

The HTML page [index.html](./index.html) contains a basic 3D scene created using the [A-frame](https://aframe.io/) library. The whole scene is a single HTML file; HTML files are files containing webpages. 

Documentation for A-Frame is available from https://aframe.io/docs/master/introduction/

This example illustrates the basics of creating a custom component that contains javascript logic and attaching it to an `<a-entity>`

## Javascript
The programming language for the web is [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

If you want, you can learn using [Javscript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) or figure things out as you go. 

Javascript is included in HTML files by placing it between `<script>` and `</script>` tags. 

You can also experiment with javascript by opening the javascript console in any webpage. Javascript has access to the internals of any website you are on. 

### Working with javascript in the browser
You can access the **Developer Tools** of your browser through the menu:

You should see something like this. The command line is the Javascript console.

Try typing ```console.log("Hello!")``` to see the console write ```Hello!```
