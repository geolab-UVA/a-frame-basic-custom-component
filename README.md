# A basic A-Frame scene with a custom component

The HTML page [index.html](./index.html) contains a basic 3D scene created using the [A-frame](https://aframe.io/) library. The whole scene is a single HTML file; HTML files are files containing webpages. 

Documentation for A-Frame is available from https://aframe.io/docs/master/introduction/
